Install
-------

```
pip install napalm
```


Upgrading
---------

We plan to upgrade napalm as fast as possible. Adding new methods and bugfixes. To upgrade napalm it's a simple as repeating the steps you performed while installing but adding the `-U` flag. For example:

```
pip install napalm -U
```

We will be posting news on our slack channel and on Twitter.
